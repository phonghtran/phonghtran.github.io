        <h3>What is Phong?</h3>
        <p>A UX designer with home-brewed development skills.</p>
        <h3>What is he suited for?</h3>
        <p>Wireframes, prototypes, and overall architecture planning.</p>
        <h3>What makes him different from others?</h3>
        <p>
          Soft skills and collaboration. Translating needs from the client to
          business to design to code isn’t a linear process. No one is trying
          to mess things up, but working together requires an awareness of
          what is being communicated and an active approach to staying in
          sync. It’s how you get to move fast while maintaining quality in the
          solutions. Not to mention time and budget will always be factors at
          every step.
        </p>
        <h3>Where can I fit Phong into my process?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Early in sales and pitches.</span>
            Articulating technical perspectives to the client and gut checking
            the feasibility of what’s being asked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Kick-off activities. </span>Experienced in
            workshops and research, Phong can add domain knowledge and
            translate thorny interviews.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Concepting. </span>Phong can ground designs
            in either the reality of the scope or in technological
            possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Prototypes. </span>This represents a range
            of things. It can be a simple demo to show the client more vividly
            than a sketch. Or the entire proof-of-concept to show the
            development team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Design Systems.</span> There’s an appetite
            for more than a Sketch file as a deliverable today. A living
            design system can help a company organize, govern, and scale its
            design and UI components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="--bold"> Coding. </span>If you don’t trust a
            development team to fully realize the solution, Phong can act as a
            bridge to maintaining quality to the UI and front end.

          <h4>The Ask</h4>
          <p>
            Update the seven-year old software to improve the accuracy and quality of content creators submitting
            their
            work into the system.
          </p>
          <h4>The Need</h4>

          <p>
            This startup had never had a full-time design resource before I joined. So beyond UI and UX needs, there
            was
            a
            need for an organziational transformation of how to approach making software. "Updating" the design would
            eventually include a Design System, complete refresh of personas and user research, a full discovery
            process
            with a young Product team, a thorough buy-in process with leadership, consulting on the Engineering team
            on
            how to refresh the CSS UI framework, a new QA process to include design, and staggered beta testing phases
            to
            launch.
          </p>
          <h4>How to Solve</h4>

          <p>
            As the solo designer, my attention was split between producing the design artifacts themselves while
            coaching
            colleagues up to how to walk through the design process and stakeholder management. This being a small
            company
            of 45 at the time, almost everyone was consulted or interviewed for input and perspective. Once we
            achieved
            buy-in that it was worthwhile to majorly rearchitect the front-end code, the scope was set to completely
            redesign and rethink the content creator experience.
          </p>

          <p> At the end, the final designs totaled over 200 screens to account for mobile and desktop. These screens
            would go through at least 12 iterations. Over 25 user interviews with external users for persona building
            and
            prototype testing. Internally, I conducted 3-4 workshops to get stakeholder alignment and ideation. In
            parallel, I worked with Engineering to verify the front-end frameworks that would inform the Design
            System.
            As
            MVP launch approached, the Product and Ops teams were coached on how to approach change management,
            training,
            and phased beta testing with limited launches to ensure stability and bug reporting. </p>

            <h4>The Ask</h4>
            <p>A new portal for developers.</p>
            <h4>The Need</h4>

            <p>
              The project was the culmination of realizing there were 4-6
              preexisting portals, and none fully captured the needs of their
              current developer base.
            </p>
            <h4>How to Solve</h4>

            <p>
              A series of stakeholder and user interviews and multiple workshops
              to gather the needs and incoming trends of development and financial
              innovation. Those observations and learnings would feed into a
              reimagined experience that would scale with the client into the near
              future and allow them to consolidate their portals. The final
              deliverables would be a new site architecture, wireframes, extended
              style guide, and an Angular component library to feed into the
              development teams.
            </p>
            <h4>Timeframe</h4>
            <p>3 months. One two week sprint for the component library.</p>

            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p>
              We were a small three-person team. I contributed to conducting
              research, co-facilitating workshops, synthesis. Shared the
              architecture and UX work while a visual specialist extended the
              design system. An additional deliverable was me coding Angular
              components for their development team.

            <h4>The Ask</h4>
            <p>
              A streamlined experience to tie together several different processes
              for data ingestion and chart creation.
            </p>
            <h4>The Need</h4>

            <p>
              The client was looking to articulate an idea they had of a novel way
              of performing an internal process. They were technical-minded
              stakeholders but needed a user-centric experience.
            </p>
            <h4>How to Solve</h4>

            <p>
              The client was resistant to traditional design research and
              activities and was getting frustrated with the lack of tangible
              artifacts. So I shifted the project to more project requirements and
              stakeholder alignment activities. With rapid wireframe ideation and
              daily feedback sessions, we were able to get a fuller picture of
              what concepts they wanted to emphasize.
            </p>

            <p>
              They were able to see their ideas expressed on a quick timeframe,
              and update their technical and feature needs as the UX as developed.
              We ended with a fully wired prototype, high fidelity key screens,
              and a promotional video for internal use.
            </p>
            <h4>Timeframe</h4>
            <p>4 months</p>

            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p>
              I led the pivot in the project taking over halfway through the
              timeline. Facilitating the daily standups and meetings with the
              stakeholders presenting the Figma files and changes. My main
              artifacts were the wireframes and the resulting prototype. Also
              coordinating the efforts with the high fidelity screens and video
              production with the team.

        <h4>The Ask</h4>
        <p>
          A way to improve the experience of people seeing their books
          digitally when traditionally in non-pandemic times they would see
          them physically and with others.
        </p>
        <h4>The Need</h4>

        <p>
          The problem was two-fold. One was the experience itself, but second
          was a sustainable production process that could enable those
          experiences.
        </p>
        <h4>How to Solve</h4>

        <p>
          Ultimately, the organization wasn’t ready to implement substantial
          changes to their internal teams and processes. So we packaged a set
          of documentation and web demos to show what could be possible given
          time to redo the internal processes.
        </p>
        <h4>Timeframe</h4>
        <p>4-6 weeks with a team of designers</p>

        <h4>Technical Highlights</h4>
        <p>
          The technical piece was not a new digital book platform or tool or
          app, but rather a set of demos and a “technical playbook.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The first was a small set of demos that could show how internal
          processes could be improved by focused tools. Some ingested text
          directly from the published files to automatically generate tags.
          Others showed how a simple database of tags could quickly allow
          colleagues to find specific snippets of content by topic or keyword.
          These tools don’t directly affect the digital book experience, but
          enable the organization to be nimble enough to innovate on those
          experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second key delivery was the “technical playbook.” We had a
          one-time pro-bono engagement with them, but I wanted them to be
          technically literate enough to have meaningful conversations with
          future vendors. The playbook covered all the relevant topics in a
          non-technical language, but also captured the ideas and framings for
          other partners to quickly grasp their goals.

        <p>
          Knowing that we can't be there for future projects, I made a
          document for the client to learn about technical terms, goals they
          should be aiming for, and recommendations.
